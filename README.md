# m&m city
Task2 for CPSC334 Module4: 

## description
We built a city street using Arduino ESP32s, 2 stepper motors, and 2 servo motors. We created photoresistor responsive LED lights. At the press of the green button, the barrier (controlled by a servo motor) will open, the red stoplight will turn off, the green stoplight will turn on, and a servo motor will propel the car forward. The barrier will close behind it and the stoplight will turn red. At the press of the yellow button, everything resets. The barrier opens, and a pulley system attached to a stepper motor will pull the car back to the start position. The entire time, the LEDs are sensitive to light and a separate stepper motor constantly rotates to display a sign that welcomes you to M&M city.

## installation
download the code in the github folders to two separate ESP32s, with wiring for each motor, LED, button, photoresistor etc.
